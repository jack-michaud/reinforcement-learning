My repository where I get up to speed on reinforcement learning. I'm building up my skills to eventually create an inverse reinforcement learning agent for [MineRL](https://minerl.io/). 

I'm first going through [Barto & Sutton's Reinforcement Learning - an introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book.html).
